Designing is always an ongoing process. You’re going to iterate a lot along your way to a great result. With first draft is also comes gathering of first feedback. You don’t have to come to pixel perfect design in order to start receiving feedback from your teammates, clients or potential users. To get their first thoughts and to start a discussion, I usually mix screens from our current designs. This allows us to start playing with real looking designs in less than a day. You can do a first simple prototype to test if things connect well together.
