To create the volcanic reaction, create a slip using the same clay body your pot is made from. For every 100 grams of wet slip, add 10 grams of silicon carbide or barium sulphate. Sieve into a 300 mesh sieve. Mix and apply where you wish the froth to take place.

Use the recipe below and glaze your pot as normal. The recipe will create a buttery glaze matt at cone 9

    Custer Feldspar 50
    Dolomite 20
    Cadycal 100 5
    EPK Kaolin 25
    
    Colorant
    Vanadium Oxide 5

Once the glaze has been applied and you are ready to fire, careful watching of the kiln near the maturing point is essential to achieve the froth. Viewing the glaze through the peephole will allow you to see when the kiln should be turned off. You will see an orange peel affect and even some popping of the glaze. This is when the temperature should be reduced.

Glaze Material
<pre>
Whiting                   23.91%
Custer Feldspar           49.73%
Edgar Plastic Kaolin (EPK)    13.18%
Silica (Flint)            13.18%
Total:                    100.00%

Add:
Titanium Dioxide          11.29%
Silicon Carbide            3.4%

A very rough glaze; not intended for food surfaces. Fine silicon carbide seems to work best. For a gray to black variation, add 7% Mason stain 6600.

**Bee's crater glaze, cone 8**

<pre>

Feldspar potash       50
China clay            25
Whiting               25
Vanadium pentoxide    5
Silicon carbide       5
Lithium carbonate     5

</pre>

For colour a wee bit of cobalt carbonate and copper oxide does well.
Apply in the consistency of mayonnaise !
